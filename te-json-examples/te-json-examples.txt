Appendix A Examples

A.1 This section contains examples of use use of the model with Restconf and JSON encoding. 

For the example we will use a 4 nodes MPLS network were RSVP-TE tunnels can be setup. The
loopbacks of each router are shown. The router network in 
figure X will be used across the section


 10.0.0.1         10.0.0.2      10.0.0.4
 +-----+         +------+      +------+
 |     |         |      |      |      |
 |  A  +---------+  B   +------+  D   |
 +--+--+         +------+      +--+---+
    |                             |
    |            +-------+        |
    |            |       |        |
    +------------+   C   +--------+
                 |       |
                 +-------+
                 10.0.0.3


A.2 Basic TE-Tunnel Creation


In the following example a RSVP-TE signaled Tunnel with no restrictions and with no protection/restoration is requested.
A tunnel is requested from router A to router D. In the example, there is no need to provide information about
primary paths

POST /restconf/data/ietf-te:te/tunnels HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Accept: application/yang-data+json
    Content-Type: application/yang-data+json
 
{
  "ietf-te:tunnel": [
    {
      "name": "Example_LSP_Tunnel_A_2",
      "encoding": "te-types:lsp-encoding-packet",
      "admin-state": "te-types:tunnel-state-up",
      "source": "10.0.0.1",
      "destination": "10.0.0.4",
      "bidirectional": "false",
      "signaling-type": "te-types:path-setup-rsvp"
    }
  ]
}

A.3 Create Global Constraint Policy: Path constraint 

In the following example a the creation of a Named Path Constratint policy is requested. This
NPC can be used later in furhter requests. In the example an NCP with 3 maximum hops is 
created.


POST /restconf/data/ietf-te:te/globals/named-path-constraints HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Accept: application/yang-data+json
    Content-Type: application/yang-data+json

{
  "ietf-te:named-path-constraint": {
          "name": "max-hop-3",
          "path-metric-bounds": {
            "path-metric-bound": {
              "metric-type": "te-types:path-metric-hop",
              "upper-bound": "3"
    }
   }
  }
}

A.4 Create tunnel with a constraint

A.4.1 Create tunnel with a constraint using a NCP

In the following example a RSVP-TE signaled Tunnel using a named path-constraint.
We will reuse the NPC defined in the previous step.



POST /restconf/data/ietf-te:te/tunnels HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Accept: application/yang-data+json
    Content-Type: application/yang-data+json

{
  "ietf-te:ietf-tunnel": [
    {
      "name": "Example_LSP_Tunnel_A_4_1",
      "encoding": "te-types:lsp-encoding-packet",
      "description": "Simple_LSP_with_named_path",
      "admin-state": "te-types:tunnel-state-up",
      "source": "10.0.0.1",
      "destination": "10.0.0.4",
      "signaling-type": "path-setup-rsvp",
      "bidirectional": "false",
      "p2p-primary-paths": [
        {
          "p2p-primary-path": {
            "name": "Simple_LSP_1",
            "use-path-computation": "True",
            "named-path-constraint": "path-metric-delay-minimum"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

A.4.1 Create tunnel with indicating the constraint
In the following example a RSVP-TE signaled Tunnel in which the 
constraint is explicetly indicated. 

POST /restconf/data/ietf-te:te/tunnels HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Accept: application/yang-data+json
    Content-Type: application/yang-data+json

{
  "ietf-te:tunnel": [
    {
      "name": "Example_LSP_Tunnel_A_4_2",
      "encoding": "te-types:lsp-encoding-packet",
      "admin-state": "te-types:tunnel-state-up",
      "source": "10.0.0.1",
      "destination": "10.0.0.4",
      "bidirectional": "false",
      "signaling-type": "te-types:path-setup-rsvp",
      "p2p-primary-paths": {
        "p2p-primary-path": [
          {
            "name": "path1",
            "path-metric-bounds": {
              "path-metric-bound": {
                "metric-type": "te-types:path-metric-delay-average",
                "upper-bound": "3"
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}

A.5 Retrieve the information of a created tunnel
The following example queries the information of the tunnel created in the previous step 
GET  /restconf/data/ietf-te:te/tunnels/tunnel="Example_LSP_Tunnel_A_4_1"/p2p-primary-paths/ HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Accept: application/yang-data+json

The request, with status code 200 would include, for example, the following json:

{
  "ietf-te:p2p-primary-paths": {
    "p2p-primary-path": [
      {
        "name": "path1",
        "path-computation-method": "te-types:path-locally-computed",
        "lsps": {
          "lsp": [
            {
              "tunnel-name": "Primary_LSP_for_Example_LSP_Tunnel_A_4_1",
              "node": "10.0.0.1 ",
              "lsp-id": "3442344",
              "path-properties": {
                "path-route-objects": {
                  "path-route-object": [
                    {
                      "index": "1",
                      "numbered-node-hop": {
                        "node-id": "10.0.0.2"
                      }
                    },
                    {
                      "index": "2",
                      "numbered-node-hop": {
                        "node-id": "10.0.0.4"
                      }
                    }
                  ]
                }
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
