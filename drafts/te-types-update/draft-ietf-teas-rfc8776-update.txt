1.  Introduction

   After the publication of [RFC8776], few additional common data types,
   identities, and groupings have been defined.  Given their broad
   applicability this document defines them as part of the revised ietf-
   te-types YANG model.

   Editors' note: Copy the text from [RFC8776] and merge it with the
   content of this section before WG LC if the RFC8876-bis approach is
   confirmed.

   CHANGE NOTE: These definitions have been developed in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te], [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-path-computation] and
   [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-l3-te-topo] and are quite mature:
   [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te] and [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-path-computation] in
   particular are in WG Last Call and some definitions have been moved
   to this document as part of WG LC comments resolution.

   RFC Editor: remove the CHANGE NOTE above and this note

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Terminology

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
   [RFC7950].

1.3.  Prefixes in Data Node Names

   In this document, names of data nodes and other data model objects
   are prefixed using the standard prefix associated with the
   corresponding YANG imported modules, as shown in Table 1.

   this document.

2.  Acronyms and Abbreviations

   Editors' note: Copy the text from [RFC8776] before WG LC if the
   RFC8876-bis approach is confirmed.

3.  Overview

3.1.  TE Types Module Contents

   Editors' note: Copy the text from [RFC8776] and merge it with the
   content of this section before WG LC if the RFC8876-bis approach is
   confirmed.

   The module ietf-te-types updates the following YANG identities
   defined in [RFC8776]:

   association-type:

      A base YANG identity for supported LSP association types as
      defined in [RFC6780], [RFC4872], [RFC4873] and [RFC8800]

   objective-function-type:

      A base YANG identity for supported path objective functions, as
      defined in [RFC5541].

   CHANGE NOTE: The association-type-diversity identity, defined in
   [RFC8800] has been added to the association-type base identity.  The
   of-minimize-agg-bandwidth-consumption, of-minimize-load-most-loaded-
   link and of-minimize-cost-path-set, defined in [RFC5541], have been
   obsoleted because not applicable to paths but to Synchronization
   VECtor (SVEC) objects.

   RFC Editor: remove the CHANGE NOTE above and this note

   The module ietf-te-types has been updated to add the following YANG
   identities, types and groupings which can be reused by TE YANG
   models:

   bandwidth-scientific-notation:

      This data type represents the bandwidth in bit-per-second, using
      the scientific notation (e.g., 10e3).

   lsp-provisioning-error-reason:

Internet-Draft          Yang updates for TE Types           October 2022


      A base YANG identity for reporting LSP provisioning error reasons.
      No standard LPS provisioning error reasons are defined in this
      document.

   identity path-computation-error-reason:

      A base YANG identity for reporting path computation error reasons,
      as defined in [RFC5440], [RFC5441], [RFC5520], [RFC5557],

   Editors' Note: how to describe the path computation error reasons
   defined in this document?

   tunnel-actions-type:

      A base YANG identity for tunnel actions.

   Editors' Note: check whether standard tunnel actions should be
   defined in this document or not.

   protocol-origin-type:

      A base YANG identity for the type of protocol origin, as defined
      in [RFC5440] and [RFC5512].

   Editors' Note: how to describe the protocol origin types defined in
   this document?

   svec-objective-function-type:

      A base YANG identity for supported SVEC objective functions, as
      defined in [RFC5541] and [RFC8685].

   svec-metric-type:

      A base YANG identity for supported SVEC objective functions, as
      defined in [RFC5541].

   encoding-and-switching-type:

      This is a common grouping to define the LSP encoding and switching
      types.

   Editors' Note: how to describe the tunnel-admin-auto, which is
   defined in this document as derived from tunnel-admin-status-type
   base identity?

5.  Packet TE Types YANG Module

   Editors' note: Copy the text from [RFC8776] before WG LC if the
   RFC8876-bis approach is confirmed.

6.  IANA Considerations

   For the following URIs in the "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688], IANA has
   updated the reference field to refer to this document:

         URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-te-types
         Registrant Contact:  The IESG.
         XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

         URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-te-packet-types
         Registrant Contact:  The IESG.
         XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document also adds updated YANG modules to the "YANG Module
   Names" registry [RFC7950]:

         name:      ietf-te-types
         namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-te-types
         prefix:    te-types
         reference: RFC XXXX

         name:      ietf-te-packet-types
         namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-te-packet-types
         prefix:    te-packet-types
         reference: RFC XXXX

   RFC Editor Note: Please replace XXXX with the RFC number assigned to
   this document.

7.  Security Considerations

   Editors' note: Copy the text from [RFC8776] before WG LC if the
   RFC8876-bis approach is confirmed.

   The security considerations defined in section 7 of [RFC8776] applies
   to the revision of the ietf-te-types YANG module.

   This document just adds new typedefs and groupings to the YANG
   modules defined in [RFC8776] and therefore it does not introduce
   additional considerations.

A.1.  TE Types YANG Diffs

   RFC Editor Note: please remove this appendix before publication.

   This section provides the diff between the YANG module in section 3.1
   of [RFC8776] and the YANG model revision in Section 4.

   The intention of this appendix is to facilitate focusing the review
   of the YANG model in Section 4 to the changes compared with the YANG
   model in [RFC8776].

   This diff has been generated using the following UNIX commands to
   compare the YANG module revisions in section 3.1 of [RFC8776] and in
   Section 4:

  diff ietf-te-types@2020-06-10.yang ietf-te-types.yang > model-diff.txt
  sed 's/^/    /' model-diff.txt > model-diff-spaces.txt
  sed 's/^    >   /    >   /' model-diff-spaces.txt > model-updates.txt

   The output (model-updates.txt) is reported here:

Appendix B.  Option Considered for updating RFC8776

   RFC Editor Note: please remove this appendix before publication.

   The concern is how to be able to update the ietf-te-types YANG module
   published in [RFC8776] without delaying too much the progress of the
   mature WG documents.

   Three possible options have been identified to address this concern.

   One option is to keep these definitions in the YANG modules where
   they have initially been defined: other YANG modules can still import
   them.  The drawback of this approach is that it defeating the value
   of common YANG modules like ietf-te-types since common definitions
   will be spread around multiple specific YANG modules.

   A second option is to define them in a new common YANG module (e.g.,
   ietf-te-types-ext).  The drawback of this approach is that it will
   increase the number of YANG modules providing tiny updates to the
   ietf-te-types YANG module.

   A third option is to develop a revision of the ietf-te-types YANG
   module within an RFC8776-bis.  The drawback of this approach is that
   the process for developing a big RFC8776-bis just for a tiny update
   is too high.  Moreover, as suggested during IETF 113 Netmod WG
   discussion, a new revision of the ietf-te-packet-types YANG module,
   which is also defined in [RFC8776] but it does not need to be
   revised, needs to be published just to change its reference to
   RFC8776-bis (see [RFC9314]).

   A fourth option, considered in the -00 WG version, was to:

   *  describe within the document only the updates to the ietf-te-types
      YANG module proposed by this document;

   *  include the whole updated YANG model within the main body;

   *  add some notes, to be removed before publication, within updated
      YANG model to focus the review only to the updates to the ietf-te-
      types YANG module proposed by this document.

   Based on the feedbacks from IETF 114 discussion, this version has
   been restructured to become an RFC8776-bis, with some notes, to be
   removed before publication, to focus the review only to the updates
   to the ietf-te-types YANG module proposed by this document.

   During the Netmod WG session at IETF 114, an alternative process has
   been introduced:

   https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/114/materials/slides-114-netmod-
   ad-topic-managing-the-evolution-of-ietf-yang-modules-00.pdf

   Future updates of this document could align with the proposed
   approach.

   Therefore, in order to avoid useless editorial work, this version of
   the document has been structured to become an RFC8776-bis but not all
   the existing text in [RFC8776] has been copied: some editors' notes

   has been inserted instead.  These editors' note will be removed and
   replaced by actual text copied from [RFC8776] before WG LC if the
   RFC8776-bis approach is confirmed.

   The authors would like to thank Robert Wilton, Lou Berger, Mahesh
   Jethanandani and Jeff Haas for their valuable input to the discussion
   about the process to follow to provide tiny updates to a YANG module
   already published as an RFC.
