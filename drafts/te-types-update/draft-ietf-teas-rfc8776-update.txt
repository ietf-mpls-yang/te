1.  Introduction

   YANG [RFC6020] [RFC7950] is a data modeling language used to model
   configuration data, state data, Remote Procedure Calls, and
   notifications for network management protocols such as the Network
   Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].
   The YANG language supports a small set of built-in data types and
   provides mechanisms to derive other types from the built-in types.

Internet-Draft            TE Common YANG Types            September 2024


   This document introduces a collection of common data types derived
   from the built-in YANG data types.  The derived data types,
   identities, and groupings are mainly designed to be the common
   definitions applicable for modeling Traffic Engineering (TE) features
   in model(s) defined outside of this document.  Nevertheless, these
   common definitions can be used by any other module per the guidance
   in Section 4.12 of [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis].

   This document adds new common data types, identities, and groupings
   to both the "ietf-te-types" and the "ietf-te-packet-types" YANG
   models and obsoletes [RFC8776].  For further details, refer to
   Appendix B.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
   [RFC7950].

      RFC Editor: The document uses "CHANGE NOTE" to ease identifying
      the changes vs. RFC8776.  Please remove these notes.

1.2.  Tree Diagrams

   Tree diagrams used in this document follow the notation defined in
   [RFC8340].

1.3.  Prefixes in Data Node Names

   Names of data nodes and other data model objects are prefixed using
   the standard prefix associated with the corresponding YANG imported
   modules, as shown in Table 1.

Internet-Draft            TE Common YANG Types            September 2024


   PM:  Performance Metrics

3.  Overview

   This document defines two YANG modules for common TE types: "ietf-te-
   types" for TE generic types and "ietf-te-packet-types" for packet-
   specific types.  Other technology-specific TE types are outside the
   scope of this document.

3.1.  TE Types Module Contents

   The "ietf-te-types" module (Section 4) contains common TE types that
   are independent and agnostic of any specific technology or control-
   plane instance.

   The "ietf-te-types" module contains the following YANG reusable
   groupings:

   te-bandwidth:  A YANG grouping that defines the generic TE bandwidth.
      The modeling structure allows augmentation for each technology.
      For unspecified technologies, the string-encoded "te-bandwidth"
      type is used.

   te-label:  A YANG grouping that defines the generic TE label.  The
      modeling structure allows augmentation for each technology.  For
      unspecified technologies, "rt-types:generalized-label" is used.

   performance-metrics-attributes:  A YANG grouping that defines one-way
      and two-way measured Performance Metrics (PM) and indications of
      anomalies on link(s) or the path as defined in [RFC7471],
      [RFC8570], and [RFC7823].

   performance-metrics-throttle-container:  A YANG grouping that defines
      configurable thresholds for advertisement suppression and
      measurement intervals.

   The "ietf-te-types" module contains the following YANG reusable data
   types:

   te-ds-class:  A type representing the Differentiated Services (DS)
      Class-Type of traffic as defined in [RFC4124].

   te-label-direction:  An enumerated type for specifying the forward or
      reverse direction of a label.

   te-hop-type:  An enumerated type for specifying that a hop is loose
      or strict.

Internet-Draft            TE Common YANG Types            September 2024


   te-global-id:  A type representing the identifier that uniquely
      identifies an operator, which can be either a provider or a
      client.  The definition of this type is taken from Section 3 of
      [RFC6370] and Section 3 of [RFC5003].  This attribute type is used
      solely to provide a globally unique context for TE topologies.

   te-node-id:  A type representing the identifier for a node in a TE
      topology.  The identifier is represented either as 4 octets in
      dotted-quad notation or as 16 octets in full, mixed, shortened, or
      shortened-mixed IPv6 address notation.

      This attribute MAY be mapped to the Router Address TLV described
      in Section 2.4.1 of [RFC3630], the TE Router ID described in
      Section 6.2 of [RFC6827], the Traffic Engineering Router ID TLV
      described in Section 4.3 of [RFC5305], or the TE Router ID TLV
      described in Section 3.2.1 of [RFC6119].

      The reachability of such a TE node MAY be achieved by a mechanism
      such as that described in Section 6.2 of [RFC6827].

   te-topology-id:  A type representing the identifier for a topology.
      It is optional to have one or more prefixes at the beginning,
      separated by colons.  The prefixes can be "network-types" as
      defined in the "ietf-network" module in [RFC8345], to help the
      user better understand the topology before further inquiry is
      made.

   te-tp-id:  A type representing the identifier of a TE interface Link
      Termination Point (LTP) on a specific TE node where the TE link
      connects.  This attribute is mapped to a local or remote link
      identifier [RFC3630] [RFC5305].

   te-path-disjointness:  A type representing the different resource
      disjointness options for a TE tunnel path as defined in [RFC4872].

   admin-groups:  A union type for a TE link's classic or extended
      administrative groups as defined in [RFC3630], [RFC5305], and
      [RFC7308].

   srlg:  A type representing the Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) as
      defined in [RFC4203] and [RFC5307].

   te-metric:  A type representing the TE metric as defined in
      [RFC3785].

   te-recovery-status:  An enumerated type for the different statuses of
      a recovery action as defined in [RFC4427] and [RFC6378].

Internet-Draft            TE Common YANG Types            September 2024


   The "ietf-te-types" module contains the following YANG reusable
   identities:

   path-attribute-flags:  A base YANG identity for supported LSP path
      flags as defined in [RFC3209], [RFC4090], [RFC4736], [RFC5712],
      [RFC4920], [RFC5420], [RFC7570], [RFC4875], [RFC5151], [RFC5150],
      [RFC6001], [RFC6790], [RFC7260], [RFC8001], [RFC8149], and
      [RFC8169].

   link-protection-type:  A base YANG identity for supported link
      protection types as defined in [RFC4872] and [RFC4427].

   restoration-scheme-type:  A base YANG identity for supported LSP
      restoration schemes as defined in [RFC4872].

   protection-external-commands:  A base YANG identity for supported
      protection-related external commands used for troubleshooting
      purposes, as defined in [RFC4427] and [ITU_G.808.1].

      CHANGE NOTE: The description and reference of the identity action-
      exercise, which applies only to APS and it is not defined in
      RFC4427, has been updated to reference ITU-T G.808.1.

   association-type:  A base YANG identity for supported LSP association
      types as defined in [RFC6780], [RFC4872], [RFC4873], and
      [RFC8800].

      CHANGE NOTE: The association-type-diversity identity, defined in
      [RFC8800] has been added to the association-type base identity.

   objective-function-type:  A base YANG identity for supported path
      objective functions as defined in [RFC5541].

      CHANGE NOTE: The objective-function-type identity has been
      redefined to be used only for path objective functions and a new
      svec-objective-function-type identity has been added for the
      Synchronization VECtor (SVEC) objective functions.  Therefore the
      of-minimize-agg-bandwidth-consumption, of-minimize-load-most-
      loaded-link and of-minimize-cost-path-set identities, defined in
      [RFC5541] and derived from the objective-function-type identity,
      have been obsoleted because not applicable to paths but to
      Synchronization VECtor (SVEC) objects.

   te-tunnel-type:  A base YANG identity for supported TE tunnel types
      as defined in [RFC3209] and [RFC4875].

   lsp-encoding-types:  A base YANG identity for supported LSP encoding
      types as defined in [RFC3471].

      protection types as defined in [RFC4872] and [RFC4873].

   switching-capabilities:  A base YANG identity for supported interface
      switching capabilities as defined in [RFC3471].

   resource-affinities-type:  A base YANG identity for supported
      attribute filters associated with a tunnel that must be satisfied
      for a link to be acceptable as defined in [RFC2702] and [RFC3209].

      types as defined in [RFC3630] [RFC3785], [RFC5440], [RFC7471],
      [RFC8233], [RFC8570] and [I-D.ietf-pce-sid-algo].

      The unit of the path metric value is interpreted in the context of
      the path metric type.  The derived identities SHOULD describe the
      unit and maximum value of the path metric types they define.

      For example, the bound of the 'path-metric-loss', defined in
      'ietf-te-packet-types', is defined in multiples of the basic unit
      0.000003% as described in [RFC7471] and [RFC8570].

   explicit-route-hop:  A YANG grouping that defines supported explicit
      routes as defined in [RFC3209] and [RFC3477].

   te-link-access-type:  An enumerated type for the different TE link
      access types as defined in [RFC3630].

      CHANGE NOTE: The module "ietf-te-types" has been updated to add
      the following YANG identities, types and groupings.

   lsp-provisioning-error-reason:  A base YANG identity for reporting
      LSP provisioning error reasons.  No standard LPS provisioning
      error reasons are defined in this document.

      functions as defined in [RFC5541].

   encoding-and-switching-type:  This is a common grouping to define the
      LSP encoding and switching types.

      CHANGE NOTE: The tunnel-admin-state-auto YANG identity, derived
      from the tunnel-admin-status-type base YANG identity has also been
      added.  No description is provided, since no description for the
      tunnel-admin-status-type base YANG identity has been provided in
      RFC8776.

      CHANGE NOTE: The lsp-restoration-restore-none YANG identity,
      derived from the lsp-restoration-type base YANG identity has also

   [RFC5441], [RFC5520], [RFC5557], [RFC8306], and [RFC8685].

   It also defines the following additional YANG reusable identities for
   reporting also the following path computation error reasons:

   path-computation-error-no-topology:  A YANG identity for reporting
      path computation error when there is no topology with the provided
      topology identifier.

3.1.2.  Protocol Origin

   The "ietf-te-types" module contains the YANG reusable identities for

   te-packet-path-bandwidth:  A YANG grouping that defines the path
      bandwidth information and could be used in any Packet TE model
      (e.g., MPLS-TE topology model) for the path bandwidth
      representation (e.g., the bandwidth of an MPLS-TE LSP).

      All the path and LSP bandwidth related sections in the "ietf-te-
      types" generic module, Section 4, need to be augmented with this
      grouping for the usage of Packet TE technologies.

      The Packet TE path bandwidth can be represented by a bandwidth
      profile.

      NOTE: Other formats for the MPLS-TE path bandwidth are defined in
      [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te-mpls] and they could be added in a future
      update of this document.

   te-packet-link-bandwidth:  A YANG grouping that defines the link
      bandwidth information and could be used in any Packet TE model
      (e.g., MPLS-TE topology) for link bandwidth representation.

      All the link bandwidth related sections in the "ietf-te-types"
      generic module, Section 4, need to be augmented with this grouping
      for the usage of Packet TE technologies.

4.  TE Types YANG Module

   The "ietf-te-types" module imports from the following modules:

   *  "ietf-yang-types" and "ietf-inet-types" as defined in [RFC6991]

   *  "ietf-routing-types" as defined in [RFC8294]

   In addition to [RFC6991] and [RFC8294], this module references the
   following documents in defining the types and YANG groupings:
   [RFC9522], [RFC4090], [RFC4202], [RFC4328], [RFC4561], [RFC4657],
   [RFC4736], [RFC6004], [RFC6511], [RFC7139], [RFC7308], [RFC7551],
   [RFC7571], [RFC7579], and [ITU-T_G.709].

      CHANGE NOTE: Please focus your review only on the updates to the
      YANG model: see also Appendix B.1.

            this attribute is used to specify the positions
            of the used labels.  This is represented in big endian as
            'hex-string'.

            In case the restriction is 'inclusive', the bit-position is
            set if the corresponding mapped label is available.
            In this case, if the range-bitmap is not present, all the
            labels in the range are available.

            In case the restriction is 'exclusive', the bit-position is
            set if the corresponding mapped label is not available.
            In this case, if the range-bitmap is not present, all the
            labels in the range are not available.

            The most significant byte in the hex-string is the farthest
            to the left in the byte sequence.  Leading zero bytes in the
            configured value may be omitted for brevity.
            Each bit position in the 'range-bitmap' 'hex-string' maps
            to a label in the range derived from 'label-start'.

            For example, assuming that 'label-start' = 16000 and
            'range-bitmap' = 0x01000001, then:

            - bit position (0) is set, and the corresponding mapped
              label from the range is 16000 + (0 * 'label-step') or
              16000 for default 'label-step' = 1.
            - bit position (24) is set, and the corresponding mapped
              label from the range is 16000 + (24 * 'label-step') or
              16024 for default 'label-step' = 1.";

   This document requests IANA to update the following URIs in the "IETF
   XML Registry" [RFC3688] to refer to this document:

         URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-te-types

   This document also requests IANA to update the following YANG modules
   to the "YANG Module Names" registry [RFC7950]:

7.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   The YANG module in this document defines common TE type definitions
   (e.g., typedef, identity, and grouping statements) in YANG data
   modeling language to be imported and used by other TE modules.  When
   imported and used, the resultant schema will have data nodes that can
   be writable or readable.  Access to such data nodes may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  Write
   operations (e.g., edit-config) to these data nodes without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

Appendix B.  Changes from RFC 8776

   This version adds new common data types, identities, and groupings to
   the YANG modules.  It also updates some of the existing data types,
   identities, and groupings in the YANG modules and fixes few bugs in
   [RFC8776].

   The following new identities have been added to the 'ietf-te-types'
   module:

   *  lsp-provisioning-error-reason;

      -  link-tp-id.

         The mandatory true statements for the node-id and link-tp-id
         have been replaced by must statements that requires at least
         the presence of:

         o  node-id or node-id-uri;

         o  link-tp-id or link-tp-id-uri.

      The following leaves, already defined in [RFC8776], have been
      updated in the 'optimization-metric-entry':

      -  metric-type;

         The base identity has been updated without impacting the set of
         derived identities that are allowed.

   *  tunnel-constraints;

      The following new leaf have been added to the 'tunnel-constraints'
      grouping:

      -  network-id;

   *  path-constraints-route-objects:

      The following container, already defined in [RFC8776], has been
      updated in the 'path-constraints-route-objects':

      -  explicit-route-objects-always;

         The container has been renamed as 'explicit-route-objects'.
         This change is not affecting any IETF standard YANG models
         since this grouping has not yet been used by any YANG model
         defined in existing IETF RFCs.

   *  generic-path-metric-bounds:

      The following leaves, already defined in [RFC8776], have been
      updated in the 'optimization-metric-entry':

      -  metric-type;

         The base identity has been updated to:

         o  increase the set of derived identities that are allowed and;

         o  remove from this set the 'path-metric-optimize-includes' and

      The following container, already defined in [RFC8776], has been
      deprecated:

      -  tiebreakers.

   The following identities, already defined in [RFC8776], have been
   obsoletes in the 'ietf-te-types' module for bug fixing:

   *  of-minimize-agg-bandwidth-consumption;

   *  of-minimize-load-most-loaded-link;

   *  of-minimize-cost-path-set;

   *  lsp-protection-reroute-extra;

   *  lsp-protection-reroute.

B.1.  TE Types YANG Diffs

   RFC Editor: please remove this appendix before publication.

   This section provides the diff between the YANG module in section 3.1
   of [RFC8776] and the YANG model revision in Section 4.

   The intention of this appendix is to facilitate focusing the review
   of the YANG model in Section 4 to the changes compared with the YANG
   model in [RFC8776].

   This diff has been generated using the following UNIX commands to
   compare the YANG module revisions in section 3.1 of [RFC8776] and in
   Section 4:

   diff ietf-te-types@2020-06-10.yang ietf-te-types.yang
        > model-diff.txt
   sed 's/^/    /' model-diff.txt > model-diff-spaces.txt
   sed 's/^    >   /    >   /' model-diff-spaces.txt
       > model-updates.txt

   The output (model-updates.txt) is reported here:

B.2.  Packet TE Types YANG Diffs

   RFC Editor: please remove this appendix before publication.

   This section provides the diff between the YANG module in section 3.2
   of [RFC8776] and the YANG model revision in Section 5.

   The intention of this appendix is to facilitate focusing the review
   of the YANG model in Section 5 to the changes compared with the YANG
   model in [RFC8776].

   This diff has been generated using the following UNIX commands to
   compare the YANG module revisions in section 3.2 of [RFC8776] and in
   Section 5:

Appendix C.  Option Considered for updating RFC8776

   RFC Editor: please remove this appendix before publication.

Internet-Draft            TE Common YANG Types            September 2024


   The concern is how to be able to update the ietf-te-types YANG module
   published in [RFC8776] without delaying too much the progress of the
   mature WG documents.

   Three possible options have been identified to address this concern.

   One option is to keep these definitions in the YANG modules where
   they have initially been defined: other YANG modules can still import
   them.  The drawback of this approach is that it defeating the value
   of common YANG modules like ietf-te-types since common definitions
   will be spread around multiple specific YANG modules.

   A second option is to define them in a new common YANG module (e.g.,
   ietf-te-types-ext).  The drawback of this approach is that it will
   increase the number of YANG modules providing tiny updates to the
   ietf-te-types YANG module.

   A third option is to develop a revision of the ietf-te-types YANG
   module within an RFC8776-bis.  The drawback of this approach is that
   the process for developing a big RFC8776-bis just for a tiny update
   is too high.  Moreover, as suggested during IETF 113 Netmod WG
   discussion, a new revision of the ietf-te-packet-types YANG module,
   which is also defined in [RFC8776] but it does not need to be
   revised, needs to be published just to change its reference to
   RFC8776-bis (see [RFC9314]).

   A fourth option, considered in the -00 WG version, was to:

   *  describe within the document only the updates to the ietf-te-types
      YANG module proposed by this document;

   *  include the whole updated YANG model within the main body;

   *  add some notes, to be removed before publication, within updated
      YANG model to focus the review only to the updates to the ietf-te-
      types YANG module proposed by this document.

   Based on the feedbacks from IETF 114 discussion, this version has
   been restructured to become an RFC8776-bis, with some notes, to be
   removed before publication, to focus the review only to the updates
   to the ietf-te-types YANG module proposed by this document.

   During the Netmod WG session at IETF 114, an alternative process has
   been introduced:

   approach.
