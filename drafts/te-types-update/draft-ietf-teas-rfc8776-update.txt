1.  Introduction

   YANG [RFC6020] [RFC7950] is a data modeling language used to model
   configuration data, state data, Remote Procedure Calls, and
   notifications for network management protocols such as the Network
   Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) [RFC6241].  The YANG language
   supports a small set of built-in data types and provides mechanisms
   to derive other types from the built-in types.

Internet-Draft            TE Common YANG Types            September 2023


   This document introduces a collection of common data types derived
   from the built-in YANG data types.  The derived types and groupings
   are designed to be the common types applicable for modeling Traffic
   Engineering (TE) features in model(s) defined outside of this
   document.

   This document adds few additional common data types, identities, and
   groupings to both the "ietf-te-types" and the "ietf-te-packet-types"
   YANG models and obsoletes [RFC8776].

   For further details, see the revision statements of the YANG modules
   in Sections X and Y or the summary in Appendix A.

   CHANGE NOTE: These definitions have been developed in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te], [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-path-computation] and
   [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-l3-te-topo] and are quite mature:
   [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te] and [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-path-computation] in
   particular are in WG Last Call and some definitions have been moved
   to this document as part of WG LC comments resolution.

3.  Overview

   This document defines two YANG modules for common TE types: "ietf-te-
   types" for TE generic types and "ietf-te-packet-types" for packet-
   specific types.  Other technology-specific TE types are outside the
   scope of this document.

3.1.  TE Types Module Contents

   The "ietf-te-types" module (Section 4) contains common TE types that
   are independent and agnostic of any specific technology or control-
   plane instance.

   The "ietf-te-types" module contains the following YANG reusable types
   and groupings:

Internet-Draft            TE Common YANG Types            September 2023


   te-bandwidth:

      A YANG grouping that defines the generic TE bandwidth.  The
      modeling structure allows augmentation for each technology.  For
      unspecified technologies, the string-encoded "te-bandwidth" type
      is used.

   te-label:

      A YANG grouping that defines the generic TE label.  The modeling
      structure allows augmentation for each technology.  For
      unspecified technologies, "rt-types:generalized-label" is used.

   performance-metrics-attributes:

      A YANG grouping that defines one-way and two-way measured
      Performance Metrics (PM) and indications of anomalies on link(s)
      or the path as defined in [RFC7471], [RFC8570], and [RFC7823].

   performance-metrics-throttle-container:

      A YANG grouping that defines configurable thresholds for
      advertisement suppression and measurement intervals.

   te-ds-class:

      A type representing the Differentiated Services (DS) Class-Type of
      traffic as defined in [RFC4124].

   te-label-direction:

      An enumerated type for specifying the forward or reverse direction
      of a label.

   te-hop-type:

      An enumerated type for specifying that a hop is loose or strict.

   te-global-id:

      A type representing the identifier that uniquely identifies an
      operator, which can be either a provider or a client.  The
      definition of this type is taken from [RFC6370] and [RFC5003].
      This attribute type is used solely to provide a globally unique
      context for TE topologies.

   te-node-id:




Busi, et al.              Expires 18 March 2024                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft            TE Common YANG Types            September 2023


      A type representing the identifier for a node in a TE topology.
      The identifier is represented as 4 octets in dotted-quad notation.
      This attribute MAY be mapped to the Router Address TLV described
      in Section 2.4.1 of [RFC3630], the TE Router ID described in
      Section 3 of [RFC6827], the Traffic Engineering Router ID TLV
      described in Section 4.3 of [RFC5305], or the TE Router ID TLV
      described in Section 3.2.1 of [RFC6119].  The reachability of such
      a TE node MAY be achieved by a mechanism such as that described in
      Section 6.2 of [RFC6827].

   te-topology-id:

      A type representing the identifier for a topology.  It is optional
      to have one or more prefixes at the beginning, separated by
      colons.  The prefixes can be "network-types" as defined in the
      "ietf-network" module in [RFC8345], to help the user better
      understand the topology before further inquiry is made.

   te-tp-id:

      A type representing the identifier of a TE interface Link
      Termination Point (LTP) on a specific TE node where the TE link
      connects.  This attribute is mapped to a local or remote link
      identifier [RFC3630] [RFC5305].

   te-path-disjointness:

      A type representing the different resource disjointness options
      for a TE tunnel path as defined in [RFC4872].

      groups as defined in [RFC3630], [RFC5305], and [RFC7308].

   srlg:

      A type representing the Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) as defined
      in [RFC4203] and [RFC5307].

      limit bandwidth utilization of packet flows (e.g., MPLS-TE LSPs).

   te-packet-path-bandwidth

      A YANG grouping that defines the path bandwidth information and
      could be used in any Packet TE model (e.g., MPLS-TE topology
      model) for the path bandwidth representation (e.g., the bandwidth
      of an MPLS-TE LSP).

      All the path and LSP bandwidth related sections in the "ietf-te-
      types" generic module, Section 4, need to be augmented with this
      grouping for the usage of Packet TE technologies.

      The Packet TE path bandwidth can be represented by a bandwidth
      profile as follow:

   NOTE: Other formats for the MPLS-TE path bandwidth are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te-mpls] and they could be added in a future
   update of this document.

   te-packet-link-bandwidth:

      A YANG grouping that defines the link bandwidth information and
      could be used in any Packet TE model (e.g., MPLS-TE topology) for
      link bandwidth representation.

      All the link bandwidth related sections in the "ietf-te-types"
      generic module, Section 4, need to be augmented with this grouping
      for the usage of Packet TE technologies.

4.  TE Types YANG Module

   The "ietf-te-types" module imports from the following modules:

   *  "ietf-yang-types" and "ietf-inet-types" as defined in [RFC6991]

   *  "ietf-routing-types" as defined in [RFC8294]

   In addition to [RFC6991] and [RFC8294], this module references the
   following documents in defining the types and YANG groupings:
   [RFC3272], [RFC4090], [RFC4202], [RFC4328], [RFC4561], [RFC4657],
   [RFC4736], [RFC6004], [RFC6511], [RFC7139], [RFC7308], [RFC7551],
   [RFC7571], [RFC7579], and [ITU-T_G.709].

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   The YANG module in this document defines common TE type definitions
   (e.g., typedef, identity, and grouping statements) in YANG data
   modeling language to be imported and used by other TE modules.  When
   imported and used, the resultant schema will have data nodes that can
   be writable or readable.  Access to such data nodes may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  Write
   operations (e.g., edit-config) to these data nodes without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

   The security considerations spelled out in the YANG 1.1 specification
   [RFC7950] apply for this document as well.

Appendix A.  Changes from RFC 8776

   To be added in a future revision of this draft.

A.1.  TE Types YANG Diffs

   RFC Editor: please remove this appendix before publication.

   This section provides the diff between the YANG module in section 3.1
   of [RFC8776] and the YANG model revision in Section 4.

   The intention of this appendix is to facilitate focusing the review
   of the YANG model in Section 4 to the changes compared with the YANG
   model in [RFC8776].

   This diff has been generated using the following UNIX commands to
   compare the YANG module revisions in section 3.1 of [RFC8776] and in
   Section 4:

   diff ietf-te-types@2020-06-10.yang ietf-te-types.yang
        > model-diff.txt
   sed 's/^/    /' model-diff.txt > model-diff-spaces.txt
   sed 's/^    >   /    >   /' model-diff-spaces.txt
       > model-updates.txt

   The output (model-updates.txt) is reported here:

A.2.  Packet TE Types YANG Diffs

   RFC Editor: please remove this appendix before publication.

   This section provides the diff between the YANG module in section 3.2
   of [RFC8776] and the YANG model revision in Section 5.

   The intention of this appendix is to facilitate focusing the review
   of the YANG model in Section 5 to the changes compared with the YANG
   model in [RFC8776].

   This diff has been generated using the following UNIX commands to
   compare the YANG module revisions in section 3.2 of [RFC8776] and in
   Section 5:

   diff ietf-te-packet-types@2020-06-10.yang ietf-te-packet-types.yang
        > model-diff.txt
   sed 's/^/    /' model-diff.txt > model-diff-spaces.txt
   sed 's/^    >   /    >   /' model-diff-spaces.txt
       > model-updates.txt

   The output (model-updates.txt) is reported here:

Appendix B.  Option Considered for updating RFC8776

   RFC Editor: please remove this appendix before publication.

   The concern is how to be able to update the ietf-te-types YANG module
   published in [RFC8776] without delaying too much the progress of the
   mature WG documents.

   Three possible options have been identified to address this concern.

   One option is to keep these definitions in the YANG modules where
   they have initially been defined: other YANG modules can still import
   them.  The drawback of this approach is that it defeating the value
   of common YANG modules like ietf-te-types since common definitions
   will be spread around multiple specific YANG modules.

   A second option is to define them in a new common YANG module (e.g.,
   ietf-te-types-ext).  The drawback of this approach is that it will
   increase the number of YANG modules providing tiny updates to the
   ietf-te-types YANG module.

   A third option is to develop a revision of the ietf-te-types YANG
   module within an RFC8776-bis.  The drawback of this approach is that
   the process for developing a big RFC8776-bis just for a tiny update
   is too high.  Moreover, as suggested during IETF 113 Netmod WG
   discussion, a new revision of the ietf-te-packet-types YANG module,
   which is also defined in [RFC8776] but it does not need to be
   revised, needs to be published just to change its reference to
   RFC8776-bis (see [RFC9314]).

   A fourth option, considered in the -00 WG version, was to:

   *  describe within the document only the updates to the ietf-te-types
      YANG module proposed by this document;

   *  include the whole updated YANG model within the main body;

   *  add some notes, to be removed before publication, within updated
      YANG model to focus the review only to the updates to the ietf-te-
      types YANG module proposed by this document.

Internet-Draft            TE Common YANG Types            September 2023


   Based on the feedbacks from IETF 114 discussion, this version has
   been restructured to become an RFC8776-bis, with some notes, to be
   removed before publication, to focus the review only to the updates
   to the ietf-te-types YANG module proposed by this document.

   During the Netmod WG session at IETF 114, an alternative process has
   been introduced:

   https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/114/materials/slides-114-netmod-
   ad-topic-managing-the-evolution-of-ietf-yang-modules-00.pdf

   Future updates of this document could align with the proposed
   approach.

Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to thank Robert Wilton, Lou Berger, Mahesh
   Jethanandani and Jeff Haas for their valuable input to the discussion
   about the process to follow to provide tiny updates to a YANG module
   already published as an RFC.
